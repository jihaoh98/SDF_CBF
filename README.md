Combining SDF and CBF to achieve collision avoidance!

## Use
l_shape and polytope mean two different shapes of robot.

Run collision_avoidance.py to see different results, and you can change the yaml file to see different results.
```python
python collision_avoidance.py
```

integral_robot_sdf: single integral model controlled by $v_x$, $v_y$

unicycle_robot_sdf: unicycle model controlled by $v$,$\omega$
